Say you wanted to convert -100 to 16bit 2s complement binary....

100 in binary = 
0000 0000 0110 0100

Flip the bits and add 1
1111 1111 1001 1011 + 1

1111 1111 1001 1100  = -100

If you wanted to convert 100 to 16bit 2s complement binary...
it is just the same as just converting 100 normally.

If you want to know whether a binary number is negative or not look at the sign bit (the most left side bit)
