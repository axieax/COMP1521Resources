Say you wanted to convert 100 to binary/hex/octal and you didn't have the luxury of printf...

Just keep dividing the number by the base and append the remainder to the "answer"
reverse it at the end

100
/2 = 50r0
answer = 0

50
/2 = 25r0
answer = 00

25
/2 = 12r1
answer = 001

12
/2 = 6r0
answer = 0010

6
/2 = 3r0
answer = 00100


3
/2 = 1r1
answer = 001001

1
/2 = 0r1
answer = 0010011

then reverse the answer you got...
the real answer = 1100100

you can do the same with hexadecimal and octal, just divide it by 16 (for hex) or 8 (for octal) instead.
however if you have printf() available using that would be better.
