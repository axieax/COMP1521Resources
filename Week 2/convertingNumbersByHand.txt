Say you wanted to convert 100 to binary/hex/octal and you didn't have the luxury of printf...

Just keep dividing the number by the base and append the remainder to the "answer"
reverse it at the end

answer = 

100/2
= 50r0
answer = 0

50/2
= 25r0
answer = 00

25/2
= 12r1
answer = 001

12/2
= 6r0
answer = 0010

6/2
= 3r0
answer = 00100

3/2
= 1r1
answer = 001001

1/2
= 0r1
answer = 0010011

reverse answer
answer = 0110 0100
