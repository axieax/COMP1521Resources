You can work this out by looking at man 3 fopen, and then using the appropriate flags to open().

open(FilePath, O_RDONLY)

open(FilePath, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND)
Opens for writing and appending, creating the file if it doesn't exist.

open(FilePath, O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC)
Opens for writing; creates the file if it doesn't exist, otherwise truncates it.

open(FilePath, O_RDWR)
Opens for reading and writing; fails if the file doesn't exist.

open(FilePath, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC)
Opens for reading and writing; creates the file if it doesn't exist, otherwise truncates it.
