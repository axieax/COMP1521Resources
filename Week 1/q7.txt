Consider the following pair of variables

int  x;  // a variable located at address 1000 with initial value 0
int *p;  // a variable located at address 2000 with initial value 0

If each of the following statements is executed in turn, starting from the above state, show the value of both variables after each statement:

p = &x;

x = 5;

*p = 3;

x = (int)p;

x = (int)&p;

p = NULL;

*p = 1;
